# CRF for Spanish NER using Unsupervised Features
This work was inspired in Guo's paper[1] entitled "Revisiting Embedding Features for Simple Semi-supervised Learning" applied to Spanish language. Some experiments have shown that  applying some succesful methods for English NER don't have the same effect to Spanish NER.

#Requirements
[CRFSuite](https://github.com/chokkan/crfsuite)
#Data
CoNLL 2002 shared task [2] gave rise to a training and evaluation standard
for supervised NER algorithms
